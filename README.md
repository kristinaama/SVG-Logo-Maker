  ## Description:
 The objective of this application is to create an SVG Logo Generator. The user may quickly create a professional logos for a project using command line inputs. The below criteria was kept in mind when creating this application:

GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for text
THEN I can enter up to three characters
WHEN I am prompted for the text color
THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
WHEN I am prompted for a shape
THEN I am presented with a list of shapes to choose from: circle, triangle, and square
WHEN I am prompted for the shape's color
THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
WHEN I have entered input for all the prompts
THEN an SVG file is created named `logo.svg`
AND the output text "Generated logo.svg" is printed in the command line
WHEN I open the `logo.svg` file in a browser
THEN I am shown a 300x200 pixel image that matches the criteria I entered

  ## Installation:
 The JavaScript code can be downloaded via the SVG Logo Generator folder on my Github page.

  ## Usage:
  This SVG Logo Generator is intended for easy navigation by using the command line interface. The user begins by typing 'node index.js' in the command line. The prompts are intuitive and user inputs from the command line will be used to create a logo.
